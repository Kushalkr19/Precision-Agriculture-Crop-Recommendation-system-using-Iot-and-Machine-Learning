# Precision-Agriculture-Crop-Recommendation-system-using-Iot-and-Machine-Learning
 An hardware system using Nodemcu is developed to measure the vitals and is monitored on thingspeak. A
model is then built by training it using Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Logistic Regression to
predict the type of crop being cultivated.
The best model is then deployed to a web application using streamlit for real-time usage, the measured vitals
from the thingspeak are manually inputted on the web app and the suitable crop is predicted.
