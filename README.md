 An hardware system using Nodemcu is developed to measure the vitals and is monitored on thingspeak. A
model is then built by training it using Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Logistic Regression to predict the type of crop being cultivated.The best model is then deployed to a web application using streamlit for real-time usage, the measured vitals from the thingspeak are manually inputted on the web app and the suitable crop is predicted.
